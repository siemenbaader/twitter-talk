# Exam presentation outline

Intro
- turning code into a design material to better leverage design processes in hacking

Demo - 10 min
- Concept Editor (create & mix abstractions)
- REPL (beat fn into shape)
  - make a DOM dialog element.

Process & reflections (15 mins)

- arrowed cyclic graph

- Theories of use
  - guide design
  - go beyond concrete observatios of pain & fixes

- Users
  - participant observations }- 
  - interviews }- broader scope.
    [ issue of being one of the users / its risks ]
  - mapping real scenarios to proposed design

- Evolving Prototype





Reflections
-----------
Big questions I had:
- is it OK to design for oneself?
- 
- established in research, but Mozilla does not do that
















- outline graph (start from prototype!)
-  detail w artifacts:
  - interview transcripts
  - sketches
  - stages of evolving design of REPL
  
  
 User studies:
 - get to know the user better than he does himself
 - observations
 
   - benchmarking scrolling up & down



 - contrast w debate on mozilla lists?
 
Role of activity theory
- guides what kind of pains to look for
  - 
  - extrapolation
    - example: ?
    
- example: reflective practice:
  - ref practice: can use concepts & repl without having full plan
  - dist cognition: automating manual 
  




- how do they do it at startups / mozilla / google
