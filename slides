Background
  - coding is explorative (agile)
  - reflective practice (Sch√∂n)
  - surprises & re-interpretations
      - hands-on exploration / affordances
      case: concurrency, NoSQL
           
  - distributed cognition
    - writing it down
    - storing & computing in the environment
    - human: ideas & judgements
    - pc: calculation & storing
    
  - relevance theory
    - decoding
    - reference to known concepts (why rails is so powerful)
      - ostensions: hint the relevant parts
      - experience: know how to focus
      - statistics: charts vs. tables

Problem

Theories
- loop: reflective practice
- relevance theory
- (affordances)
- (direct manipulation)
- dist cognition
  - machine: symbolic reasoning. calcuate representations
  - man: ideas, decisions



Scenarios
- state machine
- CPS flow chart

# Coding
[x] alt + arrow key navigation
[S] embed proto iframe & ensure keys work ok (caps for sliding...)  :impossible:
    - deal w events swallowed
[ ] Slide margin to allow focus to leave prototype
[ ] adjust prototype size for resolution

  
  
[ ] markdown helper for slide content


[x] slide px sizes fix

# Feedback
- implement goal-oriented; show problems in current tools
- show state machines / other informant's concepts

# Demo

- alert string
- "examples of exploration"

- theories: do not make it credible for prospects
